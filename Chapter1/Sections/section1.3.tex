The rest of this thesis is organized as follows:


\begin{itemize}
  \item Chapter \ref{ch:Background} provides a more detailed background on QoE in video streaming, QoE assessment methodologies, and the QoE influence factors that need to be considered in QoE modeling.
  It also covers the literature review of the methods used for measuring and modeling the user's QoE.
  
  
  \item Chapters \ref{ch:BiLSTM}, \ref{ch:CNN}, and \ref{ch:Cumulative} presents three novel QoE prediction models.
  The work presented in these chapters has been published in \citep{Mine_BiLSTM}, \citep{Mine_CNN}, and \citep{ Mine_Cumulative}.
  

  \item After the three models have been presented, Chapter \ref{ch:Discussion} discusses the feasibility to utilize these models for QoE-based network control and management in video streaming.
  

  \item Chapter \ref{ch:Conclusion} concludes the thesis and shows potential future research work.
\end{itemize}
