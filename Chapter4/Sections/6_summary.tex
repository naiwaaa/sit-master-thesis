In this chapter, the CNN-QoE model is presented for continuous QoE prediction.
The proposed model introduces multiple improvements to the original TCN model to leverage its strengths and eliminate its drawbacks in the QoE prediction task for video streaming services.
The comprehensive evaluation across different QoE databases demonstrates that CNN-QoE model produces superior performance in terms of QoE prediction accuracy and computational complexity.
Accordingly, CNN-QoE provides a highly competitive prediction performance.
These results validate the robustness of the model in real-time QoE prediction.
