To evaluate the accuracy of the proposed model, the model hyperparameter sets and input features are used as described in Section \ref{sec:ProposedModel_Parameters} and \ref{BiLSTM:subsec:InputFeatures}, respectively.
The QoE prediction performance of the proposed model is compared with baseline models described in Section \ref{sec:Evaluation_BaselineModels}.
