Three evaluation metrics, namely, Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC), Spearman Rank Order Correlation Coefficient (SROCC) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) are considered for QoE prediction accuracy assessment.
The SROCC measures the monotonic relationship, while PCC measures the degree of linearity
between the subjective and the predicted QoE
For PCC and SROCC, a higher value illustrates a better result, while for the RMSE, the lower value is better.
