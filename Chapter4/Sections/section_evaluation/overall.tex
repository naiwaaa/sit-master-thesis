Accurate and efficient QoE prediction models provide important benefits to the deployment and operation of video streaming services.
As shown in subsection \ref{sec:EvaluationAccuracy} and \ref{sec:EvaluationComplexity}, the proposed model CNN-QoE can achieve not only the state-of-the-art QoE prediction accuracy but also the reduction on computational complexity.
Therefore, the CNN-QoE can be an excellent choice for future QoE prediction systems or QoE-aware video streaming applications.
