The following four evaluation metrics are considered:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Inference time: the time taken to predict the user QoE at any given time instant $t$.
    \item Model size: the storage size of the trained model on the hard drive.
    \item FLOPs: the number of operations performed.
    \item Number of Parameters: number of learnable parameters in the model.
\end{itemize}
