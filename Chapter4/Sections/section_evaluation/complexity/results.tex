Table \ref{tbl:Complexity_PC} show the computational complexity results of the proposed CNN-QoE compared to the TCN-QoE and LSTM-QoE.
In general, the CNN-QoE requires a higher number of parameters and FLOPs in comparison with LSTM-QoE to achieve higher accuracy.
Although the FLOPs of the proposed model are larger, the inference time is 3 times faster than the LSTM-QoE model.
This indicates that the proposed model can efficiently leverage the power of parallel computation to boost up the computing speed.
It can be seen from Table \ref{tbl:Complexity_PC} that the architecture complexity of TCN-QoE is extremely higher than our proposed CNN-QoE model in terms of number of parameters and FLOPs.
However, the accuracy of TCN-QoE is not quite comparable with the CNN-QoE as shown in Tables \ref{tbl:Accuracy_LFOVIA}, \ref{tbl:Accuracy_LiveMobileStall}, and \ref{tbl:Accuracy_LiveNetflix} .
It proves that the proposed improvement adapted on the original TCN architecture allow CNN-QoE to effectively capture the complex temporal dependencies in a sequential QoE data.
