To evaluate the QoE prediction accuracy of the proposed model, the comparison with the state-of-the-art QoE models comprising of LSTM-QoE \cite{QoEModel_LSTM}, NLSS-QoE \cite{QoEModel_NLSS}, SVR-QoE \cite{LFOVIA}, and NARX \cite{QoEModel_NARX_DynamicNetworks} will be performed.
It is worth noting that we also make a comparison with the original TCN model, or TCN-QoE for short, in the QoE prediction task.
The TCN-QoE model uses the same network hyperparameters and input features with ones described in Section \ref{sec:ProposedModel_Parameters} and \ref{BiLSTM:subsec:InputFeatures}.


To evaluate the computational complexity of the proposed model, we focus on the comparison with deep learning-based QoE prediction models since they achieve exceptionally higher accuracy.
Particularly, LSTM-QoE \cite{QoEModel_LSTM} and TCN-QoE are utilized in the comparison.
It is important to note that the LSTM-QoE \cite{QoEModel_LSTM} model hyperparameters are employed as reported in its respective works in order to ensure a fair comparison.
