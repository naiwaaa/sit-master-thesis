In this section, the model CNN-QoE is introduced to leverage the advantages and handles the problems of the TCN architecture \cite{Network_TCN} in QoE prediction for video streaming services.
The architecture employed for the CNN-QoE model is discussed in detail in the following subsections.
The model architecture hyperparameters are then analyzed to find the optimal values which can improve the QoE prediction accuracy, while minimizing the computational complexity.
