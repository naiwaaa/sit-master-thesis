In this chapter, the cumulative QoE prediction model was presented.
The model successfully and effectively incorporated the impacts of human-related influence factors to predict the cumulative perceived video quality.
In different scenarios, the proposed model achieved impressive performance, outperforming the reference model.
Additionally, it was shown that the introduced memory weight accurately mimicked human memory during a streaming session, especially when unpleasant events repeatedly occurred.
Although the correlation between DoI and subjective overall QoE was not so high due to the small number of subjects involved in the experiment, the user's interest in video content can be considered as a potential influence factor in predicting QoE.
