In this chapter, the BiLSTM-QoE model was presented to improve the QoE prediction accuracy.
Unlike unidirectional LSTM only measuring forward direction, BiLSTM considers both forward and backward dependencies, thereby it has the ability to avoid filtering out the useful information.
Despite the various QoE influence factors and the complex interactions among them, the model can provide an accurate prediction userâ€™s QoE.


In the next chapter, the CNN-QoE model is introduced to further improve the QoE prediction accuracy.
Furthermore, the model also focus on minimizing the computational complexity, resulting in a QoE prediction model that can be utilized in real-time QoE modeling and continuous monitoring.
