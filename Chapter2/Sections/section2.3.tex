The user's QoE in video streaming is affected by multiple factors.
These factors can be classified into the following four categories \citep{Survey_QoEModeling, EffectSizesOfInfluenceFactors}:


\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{System-related Influence Factors}
  consider the technical aspects of video streaming quality.
  They include the influences of the user device (e.g., computing power, screen size), network-related (e.g., bandwidth, delay), and also the application layer (e.g., video adaptation strategy, rebuffering events, bitrate switching events).


  \item \textbf{Human-related Influence Factors}
  are related to the user's information and characteristic.
  They include psychological factors of the user such as user expectations, memory and recency effects, or user's background and usage history.
  
  
  \item \textbf{Context-related Influence Factors}
  capture the environment and the context where the user views the video content.
  They address the user's location and space, subscription type, time of the day, the purpose of viewing the video, etc.
  
  
  \item \textbf{Content-related Influence Factors}
  consider the characteristics of the video content.
  They include the influence of encoding rate, encoding format, resolution, playback duration, type of video, etc.
