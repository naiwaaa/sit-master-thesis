The definition of QoE proposed by European Network on QoE in Multimedia Systems and Service (the EU Qualinet community) is:
"QoE is the degree of delight or annoyance of the user of an application or service.
It results from the fulfillment of his or her expectations with respect to the utility and/or enjoyment of the application or service in the light of the user's personality and current state" \cite{QoEDef_Qualinet, QoEDef_ITU}.
This definition has pointed out that QoE is a user-centric metric used to measure the user's satisfaction with a particular service and their perception of the service's quality.
